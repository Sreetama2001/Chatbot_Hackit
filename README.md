## WeCare Heath Bot 


### Motivation : 

As per a [report](https://www.indiaspend.com/more-indians-die-of-poor-quality-care-than-due-to-lack-of-access-to-healthcare-1-6-million-64432/) published by Lancet , **1.6 million Indians** died due to poor quality of care in 2016, nearly twice as many as due to non-utilisation of healthcare services (838,000 persons). 
So we decided to make a chatbot to provide 24*7 assistance.
